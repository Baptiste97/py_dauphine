1. Basics of Python: data types, loops, functions, list comprehensions and a glimpse of objet oriented programming. (3h)
2. Advanced Python: functional programming, generators... and an introduction to the numpy library. (3h)
3. Data Analysis with pandas: I/O operations. Working with dates/time. Financial panel data: the pandas library.  (3h)
4. High-frequency Data and Visualisation: Data visualization the matplotlib library. (3h) 
5. Regression. Optimization: Interpolation and curve fitting. Symbolic mathematics in Python. Principal component analysis. (3h)
6. Stochastic Processes in Python: Generating random numbers. Monte Carlo simulations. Simulating stock price paths (Brownian motion with jumps). Value-at-Risk and Expected Shortfall. (3h)
7. Option Pricing: Option pricing with binomial trees and Monte Carlo simulation. Least-Squares Monte Carlo for pricing American options. (3h)
8. Portfolio Theory. Efficient frontier. PCA Analysis. Test for normality. (3h)



## 2019-2020

### Project (group of 2 or 3 people)
* Option pricing - monte carlo method : Black Scholes diffusion is not enough + choose a convenient option for that
* Parallelism ([concurrent.futures](https://docs.python.org/3/library/concurrent.futures.html), Joblib, Dask...)
* [Dash](https://dash.plot.ly/) as a service to display web pages: Form to fill the parameters, display the pricing and draw some trajectories
Expected by 6th December
* Readme file is mandatory: how to install, how to use the app

### Exam
to be planned


## 2020-2021

Evaluation (20 points)
* participation (2 points)
* first assignment (3 people) (4 points) (from 3rd session, 20 minutes presentation 10 minutes Q&A)
* second assignment (3 people I will provide the list soon)(6 points)
* Exam (8 points)

### second assignment
* What to do:
develop a service based on Bokeh (user interface), with some calculations (options pricing, risk, whatever you want in finance) based on Dask or Cupy or Cudf
Pytest are mandatory
Will onboard Flake8

An article on https://medium.com/ is a bonus (e.g.: https://towardsdatascience.com/speed-cubing-for-machine-learning-a5c6775fff0b)
outcome:
simple package to install or a Google colab Notebook and a readme file
Expected by beginning of January 2021
